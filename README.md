  A simple Instagram clone I built back in my <b>2nd semester</b> just to revise Flutter basics and get into app development.<br>
  Nothing fancy — just a basic <b>home page</b> and <b>search page</b>, but it was a fun weekend project!

This is an old project, but it’s special for me as it marked the start of my app dev journey.  
Might improve it someday, or just keep it as a reminder of where I started!
